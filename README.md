## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. The task is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages are used. 

You can create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API by using this repo!
